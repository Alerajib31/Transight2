# Transight - Intelligent Transit Prediction System

## What This System Does

**Transight** is a real-time bus arrival prediction system for Route 72 in Bristol, UK (Temple Meads to UWE Frenchay). It combines live bus GPS tracking, traffic data, and computer vision to provide accurate arrival time estimates.

### Key Features

**1. Real-Time Bus Tracking**
- Shows live bus locations on a map
- Updates every 10 seconds from BODS (Bus Open Data Service)
- Displays bus speed, direction, and destination

**2. Traffic-Aware Predictions**
- Uses **TomTom Traffic Flow API** for real-time road conditions  
- **FREE tier:** 2,500 requests/day (no credit card required)
- Calculates traffic delays based on current vs. free-flow speed
- Adjusts ETAs during congestion
- **Fallback:** Time-based heuristics if API not configured
- **Setup:** See `TRAFFIC_API_SETUP.md` for free API key

**3. Crowd Detection (Computer Vision)**
- YOLOv8 AI model counts people at bus stops
- Accounts for boarding time (4 seconds per person)
- Updates predictions based on queue size

**4. Machine Learning Predictions**
- XGBoost model trained on historical data
- Inputs: traffic delay + crowd count + weather
- Output: predicted arrival delay

**5. Interactive Web Interface**
- Leaflet map showing Route 72 line and stops
- Tap any stop to see approaching buses
- Live ETA breakdown (travel time + traffic + crowd)

## How It Works (Simple)

```
User taps "Temple Meads" stop
        |
        v
System fetches:
  - Bus location (BODS API)
  - Traffic speed (TomTom API)
  - Crowd count (Database/Camera)
        |
        v
ML Model calculates:
  ETA = Travel Time + Traffic + Crowd
        |
        v
User sees: "Bus 72 arriving in 9 minutes"
```

## Data Flow Examples

### Without CV Counter (No Camera)
```
User -> Tap Stop -> Backend -> BODS API (bus location)
                              -> TomTom API (traffic)
                              -> Database (crowd = 0)
         |
    ETA = Travel Time + Traffic Delay
```

### With CV Counter (Camera Running)
```
CV Counter -> Detects 8 people -> POST to /update-sensor-data
                                        |
User -> Tap Stop -> Backend -> BODS API (bus location)
                              -> TomTom API (traffic)
                              -> Database (crowd = 8)
         |
    ETA = Travel Time + Traffic Delay + Crowd Delay
```

---

## Key Algorithms

### Traffic Delay Calculation
```python
speed_ratio = current_speed / free_flow_speed

if speed_ratio < 0.3:
    delay = (1 - speed_ratio) * 25  # Severe congestion
elif speed_ratio < 0.6:
    delay = (1 - speed_ratio) * 20  # Heavy traffic
elif speed_ratio < 0.85:
    delay = (1 - speed_ratio) * 15  # Moderate traffic
else:
    delay = 0  # Free flow
```

### ETA Calculation
```python
travel_time = (distance_km / bus_speed_kmh) * 60
crowd_delay = (crowd_count * 4) / 60  # 4 seconds per person

predicted_delay = ML_predict(traffic_delay, crowd_count, weather)

ETA = travel_time + predicted_delay
```
